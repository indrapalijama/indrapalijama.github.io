This is a mobile application created for shipping companies to handle basic functionalities such as creating bookings, tracking packages, and viewing booking history.

The developer was responsible for the programming and publishing of this application. The code is saved in a private GitHub repository as it contains confidential company data.

Due to the company's request, this application has been removed from the Google Play Store.
