Abang Express Mobile Application is an app i created that functioning as basic application for the companies transactions, such as :  create a booking, tracking the package, or see your booking list, etc.  

For this project, I was the  programmer who was responsible for developing and publishing this app.  

For the code itself is saving under a private repositories in Github because it contains a private data companies use.

From now on, this apps has been removed from google play store due to companies request, so i'm no longer have business with them anymore.
